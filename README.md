# Frontend README - Lung Disease Prediction

## Overview
This is the frontend of the **Lung Disease Prediction** application, designed to predict lung diseases based on chest X-ray images. It allows users to upload images for prediction, retrain the model with new data, and visualize the performance of the model after retraining. This frontend communicates with a FastAPI backend that handles prediction and model retraining.

## Features
- **Predict Disease**: Upload chest X-ray images and predict if the user has any of the 8 different lung diseases.
- **Retrain Model**: Retrain the model with new training data and view performance metrics such as accuracy, validation accuracy, loss, and validation loss.
- **Upload Data**: Upload training data for retraining the model.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** for the structure.
- **CSS3** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for frontend logic and communication with the backend via Fetch API.
- **FastAPI** (Backend) (Not part of this frontend code but the backend API it interacts with).
